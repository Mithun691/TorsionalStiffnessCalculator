# TorsionalStiffnessCalculator
Given the dimensions and shape of the cross-section of the beam The program computes the stress distribution,axial displacement and torsional stiffness

PoissonPDESolver uses Finite difference Methods and pmpe uses optimization of potential energy 
Both calculate the Torsional stiffness independently
